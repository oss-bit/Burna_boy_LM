The twelve jewels are basically the twelve important things
That a man should inspire for
That's the best acquisition you can have, right
And it's simple

Love, peace and happiness

To understand Nigeria, you need to appreciate where it came from
In 1900, Britain officially assumed responsibility for the administration of the whole of what we now know as Nigeria from the Niger Company
And then, gradually over the years, British protectorates were established throughout the territory
In 1914, the protectorates were amalgamated into one Nigeria
Actually, there's one additional detail that bears mentioning. In order to take over the territories from the Niger Company, the British Government paid 865,000 pounds. A huge amount in 1900. So let's establish a simple truth, the British didn't travel halfway across the world just to spread democracy
Nigeria started off as a business deal for them, between a company and a government. Incidentally, the Niger Company is still around today. Only it is known by a different name, Unilever
But that's another story
(It's Kel-P vibes)

Gotta get this money tree in the bank for us to grow
Big picture thinker, ducking the paparazzi
Staying out of Shwashi scriptures
She's a praying mosadi ga satane a nteka
Momma told me it’d be cheaper to keep her
I made momma lefika
That's my bundle of boitumelo
Walking taller than super model, stiletto
My heart singing in that Dana's falsetto
High as the polo lights in the ghetto
How she get when I'm in the middle
How she swallow what's on the menu?
Barking maar ha a na meno
Ncwanya ngwanyana eno
Stocking, stocking, stalking an instrumental
Bumping, tswakin', fucking it up a little

She got me feeling like the baddest
Motherfucker on the planet, baby

Yeah
Life is sweet when the sun up
Like the trees in the summer
When the seas are troubled
Then we all need someone
My life Omo
No be small thing Omo
We all strive for more
To live life ina comfort
So forgive me if I fumble
'Cause I am only human
Somebody move that I don’t know
Hit them with the seven box combo
Always looking out my window
Paranoid  and confused
I'm not sure anymore
Who is knocking at my door?
And so as the day comes, as I go on
Protect me Lord, I cannot trust my neighbors
Be my saviour
When that day comes
Defend me from my enemies and my neighbors

Explore my open sea
Let my emotions see
If i should stumble off my feet
I hope that no one sees
I know, no one can save us (no)
So i just put all my pain and my problems in this styrofoam cup
And drink it all away
So here we go
Feeling so good (so good)

(listen) I'm trying to walk on top of the ocean
I numb the pain
Numb the pain
Numb the pain
As the sun shine on me (on me)

Now greetings to the world
Voice of the one called Big Gong-Zilla alongside Burna Boy, ya know
Yes rude boy!

[Verse 1: Burna Boy]
Ya dun know we different
Different style we delivering
I don't have no equivalent
Different predicament
Every day a different problem
Different lie from the government
Different politics, people with different qualities
Different tings dem happening
Different feeling, looking for a different healing
Read it with a different meaning
Different book
Come with a different look
Same spliff, different toke
Different election, sell a different false hope
Then them hang us with a different rope
It's a different time, different tings pon me mind
Different steps we ah climb
While dem connive
Different egos collide
Back full of different knives

Different we look
Although we're different, still we're similar
Every man bleed blood, that's a big similarity
Seven billion show one cinema
One world we live in
And through social media become the new encyclopedia
Exposing reality in a real time
Click a button and watch a video
Then you just might find
Every man love dem family
That is another familiarity
To demonstrate the similarity
That doesn't mean there's not a big difference up in equality
Ya copy from the real original
Ya dun know we different

[Verse 3: Burna Boy]
Different acts of belligerence
But differently intelligent
Different medicine, me nah talk chemical medicine
Different leaves and remedies
Different studying of my roots and origin
Tell my truth in melodies
History teachers attest to the different lies though
Different from what me find out
You know say knowledge is the key and ah dat dem a hide out
Fuck up the youth dem mind
Bringing a different force
So different gun we ah buss
You know it ain't hard to find us

To Chelmsford HMP and my celly had it bad
So I had to have his back, niggas started fightin'
And then they cut me on my hand
So I grabbed one from the back and I flung him off the landing
You know the screws get extra ruthless when you're Black

I couldn't swear that I never knew

I met this girl on my way to school
Then we went to her place but I say to you
She dropped her books and I just played the fool
So I'm rising in place for you

I'm Jorja Smith and when I'm in a bad mood
I can make a whole room really feel as bad as I do
I overthink, "Why am I in a bad mood?"
"Why has someone put me in a bad mood?"
Loads of whys and no solutions of how to get myself out of a bad mood
Which I'm tryna work on
It's the Nigerian nightmare, Kamaru Usman
And when I am in a bad mood, I love to stop and think
So that I don't make the situation worse
I give myself time to be able to make a rational and educated decision
That'd help me through the situation
When I'm in a bad mood, I tend to be very quiet
And I go to my high power, my God

[Pre-Chorus]
When it's rainin', you wish the sun was shinin'
When it's sunshine, you wish the rain was fallin'
You're always sеarchin', never seem to find it
Lookin' in all the wrong placеs

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't seem to decide whether you're wrong or you're right
And you're just not sure about your life
Get nervous, then anxiety take over your mind
And your trouble just increase in size
When you're feelin' mad and you're angry
When you feel like you're lonely
When you feel as sad as you can feel
Say, "How bad could it be?"
How bad could it be?

[Verse 2]
Oh, there's a reason why you walk like you don't have a care in the world
All the times in your life that you had to put up with someone like me
Never should have loved you like that
Never should have listened to them there
Because even when it seems suicidal
Always have to listen to my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
When it's rainin', you wish the sun was shinin'
When it's sunshine, you wish the rain would fall
You're always searchin', never seem to find it
Lookin' in all the wrong places, ah

Disappointed with things sometimes
I just, like, put on some jazz music
Go smoke a cigar
And just go play with the kids, you know what I'm sayin'?
Go and play with my kids
Go out with the wife
Just switch that energy and just know that, you know, too blessed to be stressed
No matter what, you know what I mean?
So, a lot of things that I'm upset with
I think because people just don't know better
You know what I'm sayin'? People just don't know better

So what do you think about Burna Boy?
Fantastic artist but I think he is on a path of destruction
Why?
Well we've all seen it, we've all seen what Burna Boy can do and can't do
Burna Boy can make good music, but Burna Boy can't be a responsible artist
Burna Boy can not keep everything within, as an artist
Controversy has clouded his whole career
It just shows how, I mean
I mean from the progression from how he started
Fantastic music, you know smothered by controversy
Upon controversy, upon controversy, up 'til now
Well he has the hits, and he has that bad boy image
Which goes with the controversy as well
See talent is never enough
Burna Boy is one of the most talented Nigerian artist right now, right?
He makes good music, he's got good lyrics, but talent is never enough
If talent was enough, you know
Majek Fashek will still be number one artist maybe in Africa or the world
We've seen artist come and go
Just because they couldn't keep their career together
You know, only this year Burna Boy has been in say four, four-five controversies
From threatening to kill bloggers
To you know posting pictures of guns on his Instagram
To calling out the MAMAs because he wasn't self-nominated, he was nominated
You know he didn't have any solo nominations
To fighting with reggae artists in Southern Africa
You know and all that, threatening to kill people, I mean
If you, you can't, you can't have all that and have a peaceful career
It doesn't work that way
Controversy will kill youSee Burna Boy LiveGet tickets as low as $82You might also likeEmbed 6 ContributorsIntro: My Life Lyrics[Intro]

Burna Boy happens to be my grandson
Well he's, uh, doing very well
I see that he has started on a very good note
And his music is unique
Even though, Hip-Hop eh
But, you see, the good thing about his music is that, erm
It has meaning
And so he has a long way
He has something good
This is just the way I am, this was not my plan
Y’all won’t understand, I’m just an ordinary man

This life is a holiday
Some people go sample craze
Some people go run away
Cause it’s a mad thing when I arrive
Cameras flash when I hop out the ride
Said I’d keep it cool, but obviously I lied
They weren’t expecting nothing when my nigga went to slide

[Spoken Word: GZA]
Which one of you is the abbot?
I wanna join the temple
We shine like that travels and waves that are unbelievable
Distance and days
Radio, micro, infrared and ultraviolet
Picture so beautiful, I had to film the pilot
Coined a new grand of philosophy
That form images in your mind, quite different from photography
Anointed few, a point of view of the thinkers
No pitch, that's a glitch full of hook lines, and sinkers
The way the wise look at light, the manner of the thoughtful
There is no benefit if it's not resourceful
Four to five, the observers, they get something from it
It become routine, been there and done it
I'm in a place where perception is developed
If you can't walk on these shoes, then your feet would swell up
A medium by which thoughts are made clear
Beneath the surface, but only hurting the inner earEmbed 34 ContributorsIt’s Plenty Lyrics[Chorus]

Oh, I'd have to be twice as tall at least

Yes, I'd have to be twice as tall at least
I mean me multiplied by two (By two)

[Verse 1: Burna Boy]
I remember when I couldn't level up
I was trying, but I couldn't level up
It was rough, you see
Start feeling like I had enough
Then I contemplate giving up (Ayy)
If you're feeling like you can't level up
Omo make you no stop at all
Because right when you start feeling like you can't level up
That's when you haffi shut the devil up
I remember when I couldn't level up
No, my money couldn't level up
Doing what I must, seems like there's always another level up
That's why you always found me looking up
But sometimes inna my life you know me haffi rebel up
Might hear about my fights in the club
Every day me try and level up so me striking them hard
Me go hard until I get to God

[Verse 2: Dave]
Look, playboy, I don't need a Carti
I'm captain, I lead the army
Bad ratio, I leave the party
Three Somalis creepin' on me
Your ex wavy, we tsunami
Girl from India, sweetest nani
Head so good, now I speak Gujarati
You hardly, parred me, I'm laughing again
I assisted, man, passed to my friend
Look, money like the alphabet
If you wanna see P’s, gotta pass on the ends
Came a long way from a park in the bends
To an ’18 plate, man's parking a Benz
Far from the rest but I’m far from my best
Life is a lesson, I'm passing a test
Yes, everyting blessed
I don't want drama and I don't want stress
My girl got finesse, Caribbean flex
Body and chest, take buddy in chest
Thank God more, I grew up with less
Juss to the right, Rapz to the left
Rj in the middle, got Cee to the death
Batch full of dogs with the 60’s vets

Everything be off the top these days
I ain't write shit since my early days
And inside these veins, my blood, my DNA
Burna Boy, but I'm Johnny Blaze
Ayy, yeah, there's things that I hardly say
"How you been, mama? How's your day?"
I should talk to my granddaddy more before it's too late
Listen more to things that Roni says
Should have been by Buki's side when her mother died
Should have talked to Sound Sultan more before he fuckin' died
I should show people more love while they still alive
I should always know thе way my people feel inside
A lot of timеs, I feel my life's in a blender
So, I tell it black-and-white like a panda
Yes, I agree I'ma start makin' changes, yeah
Tryna be a better man, I been tryin'
I got it all, but I still got my anger
Been workin' hard tryna get rid of my anger

I bought a castle in France and it's the same one I built in the sand for you when I was two
I thought I painted a picture of Heaven
But it turns out it's just your room, just your room
I'd run off the end of the earth just to see if you'd catch me
When I know you'd let me fall every time

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
All I do is wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change, but (All I do)
Is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way (I need to be loved by you)

The only ting that you and me was chasin'
The kinda lovin' that they couldn't play with
You know my lovin' is an every day ting, baby

If the government refuse to develop the region
And continue the marginalization and injustice
The youths or the next people coming after us
I think will be more brutal than what we have done

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Calling me a monster, calling us fake
No way, no way, no way
Calling me a monster just 'cause we said

[Verse 1: Burna Boy]
We're from the block where it rains
Where we create barricades
Keep opposition away
That's why we strapped with  AK's
Don't get kidnapped from your place
'Cause it could happen today
Not knowing how to behave
That is a sign that you may
Just lose your life, what a waste
Your body found in a lake
You fucked around and the fisherman
Found you drowning for days
You know we come from a place
Where people smile, but it's fake
How could they smile?
If you look around, they surrounded by pain
I've seen the sky turn to grey
It took the light from the day
It's like the heads of the state
Ain't comprehending the hate
That the oppressed generate
When they've been working like slaves
To get some minimum wage
You turn around and you blame
Them for their anger and rage
Put them in shackles and chains
Because of what they became
We are the monsters you made

I bet they thought it was cool
Probably thought we was fools
When we would break all the rules
And skip them classes in school
Because the teacher dem teaching
What the white man dem teaching
Dem European teachings in my African school
So fuck the classes in school
Fuck Mungo Park and the fool
That said they found river Niger
They've been lying to you
Ain't no denying the truth
See what I'm tryin' to do
Is draw the line for the mothers crying
We're dying as youths
Come walk a mile in my shoes
See if you smile at the truth
See if you digest your food
That's when you might have a clue
Of what the fuck we go through
You're fucking lucky if you
Live through the day, better pray
That God always staying with you
Ain't fuckin' safe, any day
The reaper'll be coming for you
We need a change and it ain't no way I'ma take an excuse
My niggas findin' a way
Or fuckin' smile in the grave
This is the price that you pay

Look at us, we have given everything

This is where we belong
Stood in an empty space
The centre
You are my core
An oasis in the middle of a storm we created
This vessel, empty
Space filled with nothing but longing and hope
You left me with ache
But I am magic
You left me in pain
But in my oasis there is space to dream again
Oh, I have suffered to with those that I saw suffer
Not a hair perished, that may be true
But my mind perishes without the possibility of you

Come on, come on, have a ball if you act maturely
Ayo, who wanna get invited to a Burna party?
I got a hunnid and eighteen homies who's naughty
So, baby, don't you bring your friends if those chicks are corny
We gets it on 'til the dawn, 'til they say, "This is ridiculous"
Ladies, they love the way we come through in the clutch
Fellas who can't keep up, might as well hit the dust
And haters, bump what they say, they don't mean shh—
Yo, I give three words when I try to scoop her
Then after that, ain't got no time for no party pooper

Thirty years up in this same game, still doing our damn thang

Heard I'm a earner, had to earn a burner
Trigga nigga, Naughty Nation, marshal arsenal
Never had to use burner-burners
I'm a changed man, still on the gun range
Singing karaoke, wife wearing Dolce
Black fist, pick stuck in my gold teeth
Been winning, befriending woman
From the beginning with a dripping driver
African emblems on the engine, engine, engine
A number runner, every summer, what's hopping with ya option?
Keep it gutter witcha brother

Until finally nothing come dey fear me anymore (ye)
If only father God can talk to me
And tell me what he has in store for me
Could he let me know?
Cause only God knows the pain I feel
All day me never eat no meal
Oh all them say the good die young
Now the dead's getting younger
Age ain't nothing but numbers
This life's a jungle sometimes
I really wonder how I keep from going under
So before me mother cry and her eyes start swell
Cause her son end up like Vybz KartelEmbed 58 ContributorsOwn It Lyrics[Chorus: Stormzy]

Low kicks and punchline deadly
Everybody wanna put their chips down, bet me
You can see town when we set sail
You and I up like movers and burners

I know you're in love
Cah mi have di MAC with di extension
And mi have di money fi ya extensions
Cah mi like your hair longer than my gun, ooh-ooh-ooh
Know we have di guns and girls, haffi keep di balance
And up in my world, we nuh sleep enuh, man
Anytime it could go down, she won't hold out
She let it all out, pow-pow-pow, pow-pow

[Verse 1: J Hus]
My favorite girl had da French braids
I had a crush on her since back-a-day
She said her 'usna needs a bandage
After I come 'round and gave her the 12-gauge
You tried call my phone, but it was engaged
I was with my lil' mama, she was honey glazed
I've been crushin' on her since back then
Just the other day I gave her the MAC-10
I don't want just any girl, 'cause I'm a little choosy
But I swear I'm a sucker for a lil' cutie
I had a skin fade like Lil Boosie
And then I went and give lil' mama the lil' uzi
'Cause you got a body shape that I can't forget
The way I make you drip when I'm talkin' slick
I'm ashamed 'cause when I came, I was bustin' quick
That's why this time I came with the banana clip

[Verse 2: J Hus]
Only God can judge me, but my friend's a lifer
My life is too fast, so I can never wife her
I'm from the East Coast but she's a Westsider
I scoped her from far 'cause I'm the best sniper
Said she had the melons, so I go and get 'em
Spray with my AK-47
The way she keeps me guessin', she is a blessin'
But she only loves me for my three-fifty-seven
I think she was Bajan or maybe Trini
Every time I linked her, I had a nine milli'
I had to link a cougar with a Luger
But the next time, I bring out the big bazooka
It's the Return of the Mack, call it the sequel
I'm known as the Mack like Beanie Sigel
Before she got undressed, she was already see-through
Then she fell in love with my Desert Eagle
[Chorus: Burna Boy]
I know you're in love
Cah mi have di MAC with di extension
And mi have di money fi ya extensions
Cah mi like your hair longer than my gun, ooh-ooh-ooh

But if it wasn't for my gunplay
Then she really wouldn't love me

If a nigga ain't right, I'm correcting him
Everybody know for sure, I'ma take it there

I know that money is calling
'Cause me, I go rich before morning, yeah
I never wake up early, I got a attitude like fuck you, pay me
All my neighbours complain about the ladies, running around my mansion daily
But I don’t care, stick my middle finger in the air
'Cause I don't care, somehow I make this very, very, clear, ay
Ohh don’t you see that I came from trips all day?
Before my head explodes, I'ma just have to go with the flow, yeah
You won't see me have a lonely night, night
Might be wrong but it all feels right
Because ooh, I'm a rockstar baby
Ooh, I'm a rockstar baby
Some kind of idol, people do things that I do
I become the guy all the girls wanna say hi to
And I don't see nothing wrong, sing the lyrics to my song
Every time I sing this song, all the ladies sing along
And I still don't understand this, it's not the way I planned it
In about five minutes I’ll be hitting the stage and stealing the show like I’m a bandit
Ooh don't you see that I came from trips all day?
Before my head explodes, I’ma just have to go with the flow, eh
You won't see me have a lonely night
Might be wrong but it all feels right
Because ooh, I'm a rockstar baby
Ooh, I'm a rockstar baby
Suddenly everyone seems nice, nice
It might be wrong but it all feels right
Because ooh, I’m a rockstar baby
Ooh, I'm a rockstar baby

Load up this Nina, this one got a whistler
No cap in my rap, know this story ain't fictional (Turn, turn, turn, turn)
Opps can't write to this principle
I won't lie on an L, but I lie to the 12 (Turn)
Used to lie in my cell, I was writin' my mail
Sat there by my gun and my bitch YSL
If I style in Chanel, shawty's stylin' as well
Do you wish me well?
Ice on my wrist like it swell (Suh, suh)
Opps try drill and they fail
They got my bro fired for bail (Suh, suh)
I guess time, it will tell

Side-by-side with hammers, airing you out through the window
Black on black with the regalia, I'ma have him swimming with tilapia
'Cause when my enemies die, I get happier
Then I take a private plane out to Mali, yeah
That's my bro at the door, you should let him in

I don't even have my own attention
You say, "Please don't ever change"
But you don't like me the way I am
The sign says "Don't you tap the glass"
But I read it in reverse
"eht pat uoy t'nod syas ngis ehT"
The world tried to burn all the mercy outta me
But you know I wouldn't let it
It tried to teach me the hard way, I can't forget it
Drivin' down the coast again
The pills are kickin' in, the pills are kickin' in

She said, "I love you 'til I don't"
I am just playin' house, no idea what I'm doin' now
There are no atheists in foxholes
The pressure's gettin' to me, it's time to throw in the towel

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
'Cause I'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancin' all alone in the mornin' light
The sunshine riptide
You came back like a wave when I was feelin' alright

I went from Helly Hansen to mini mansions
The girls in Aruba doing belly dancin'
Spent half of my advance on jars from Branson
To make it through my circumstances
But you know I'm wiser now
Move like Keyser now
Got a butter soft leather just to hide my pound
Got a house in the valley, come and find me now
Got enough dough to buy the town
So I might give a six to my chick
Benz to my mom
Crib so big, it look like the center gone
Give her a couch just to spill Henney on
And been a don since Lotto's and Benneton

Give you what you ask for
So tell me if you want action
Until the lights back on

Pure like water where dey for nylon

And chill up in my villa
Together the whole night
Just get in the drop top, take the head out
And cruise with your head outside

Be payin' dues for years, streets owe me some arrears
Just did a three-peat in the league, go on check it

Man, I freestyle me no have time for no pen and pattern scribble
How many times I sing your girl come to the club and wiggle?
And she come gimme love a little
I'm man, I pretend to her a little little
When I come for drive in my car, I'm passing her
She's hopping down me car, I'm go with her
When she bends over sitting like a tiger
Yo, back to the basic fact
You're just rat
My fat to five are gone club
My real Gs are idiots
I'ma no say your girlfriend hot
Some are coming in thinking crab
I'm no taking like but a crab, crab
I'ma know say mine coming at me just exciting
And, and see the girl dem giving me inviting
Statement of the fact that I'm liking, liking, liking
Have a spear like a viking
Paparazzi everywhere when you see me arriving
And they want to know what I'm wearing or car I'm driving
They don't even give a fuck of how the way I'm surviving
So what I go strike them like thunder and lightening
Yo, I'ma go back to the lighter fact
Understand me sing writing that
No, nobody is writing that
Fight me then I'm fighting back
I know that I might react
Bring me into the yes contract
And I'm like no I'm not signing that
Call me your favorite artist all you want but I'm still not designing that bullshit
That's what we did Picasso define it as

Yeah, so it's super inspiring
But I think if you can hit on something like super, super, almost
Like psychological, about, about how the human race consumes music
And tying it into like a primal thing
You know, I like the idea of it too
Like, the concept of the album is very much like storytelling
Is that, is that right? I mean like sharing the story?
So I think the number of ways
That you can get people to have like an, "Ah-ha" moment
When they're like consuming
Like you sip like that two cokes or cigarettes
Or going to the club or gеtting an outfit to go out
You know, like, selling the album
In thosе sort of like everyday ways
But also like reinforce, like, the creative, you know?
Like, 'cause at the end of the day
You do, you will wanna promote the album in the traditional way
But almost like poking the veil off the curtain of it
But the billboard image should be different
Because, you know, like, the CD cover should be like
Him peeling off the industry or something

I've been trying to achieve

[Chorus: Burna Boy]
Remember when they said they don't believe in me no more?
I was sleeping on the ground, on the cold floor
Whole time I was grinding, I been tryin' to achieve
Working night and day, you know my people no dey sleep
I got every Louis V collection from Virgil
Now my life a fashion show, no rehearsal
Dior from Kim Jones, Bottega from Daniel
100K my ring so I'm not shaking no hands, no

[Verse 1: Burna Boy]
Really rich but grind like I ain't got shit at all
I give them just a little, but now I want it all
It's already won when they ask what I ball for
For all the times you no pick up whеn I called ya
I know when I came in to this world, I was solo
So to mе your opinion na your nyash-hole
Don't vex because I said I did it to my own, oh
If I enter fire now shey una go follow
I'm tellin' you, back in '09 I was feeling so low
No lie, no cap, God knows
No dey talk like say you know, because you no know
If he was here right now, I'll tell you ask Gambo

[Verse 2: Polo G]
In my stomach, butterflies
Ain't been the same since my brothers died
We woke up like fuck it, let's slide
Never put a ho above the guys
I have dug deep into your heart, and I discovered lies
They gon' tell my story, I'm that nigga, what they summarize
I came out a winner, I don't care what happened otherwise
Long nights I remember we don't ask to let them cutters ride
Made it out the gutter, can't go back to what I used to do
We just get money, fuck hoes, you know, the usual
And this shit forever, can't accept the thought of losin' you
Lotta pressure on me from obstacles I'm movin' through

[Verse 3: Burna Boy]
Can't believe I really came home with a Grammy
I was in the mansion celebrating with the family
You don't come from where I'm from, you may not understand me
Obviously I never cared about your understanding
Got the biggest honour from Port Harcourt City
Whole time I was there, I was just looking at my daddy
Felt like nothin' else seeing him as proud he can be
I get emotional when I talk about my daddy
Who'd have thought I'd take it this far?
Did it all with my art and it came from the heart
Now they take me to court
But it's cool because my Richard Mille is now worth half a mil
And the price goin' up so I don't need no love

[Chorus: Burna Boy]

They tell me don't you forget where you came from
But how could I forget? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh you think you boys are famous?
You just on some fake shit
Always doin' the same shit
All you girls are basic
I'm out in LA shit
But ain't on no LA shit
Catch me with the same clique
All it took was patience, yeah
Fuck a cigarette, roll up a Backwood (A Backwood)
And fuck the internet I'm from the backwoods (Backwoods)
Yeah, fuck a cigarette, roll up a blunt please
And fuck the internet I'm from the country

[Chorus: Goody Grace]
Ain't nobody ever left my town
That'll be the day I let 'em put me in the ground
Baby I'll be gone with the winds of the Winter, yeah
Ridin' through the city on my own
Probably never gonna find a place to call home
But still I'll be gone with the winds of the Winter

Everyone's in danger
Ridin' with the bangers
It's crazy what we came from, hatred and anger
Niggas on the back block
With a hunnid laptops
And a couple bank cards
Nigga that's that scam art, that part
Young boys collectin' big amounts
Wire it all to different accounts
Please don't be offended by the way I'm actin' now
I might show up unannounced
'Cause it's static with some niggas from the other side of town
I ain't scared, I rock my jewelry everywhere (Everywhere)
I don't give a fuck, I'm from the third world (Third world)
And fuck the internet, I'm really outside
So don't you ever try to play about mine
